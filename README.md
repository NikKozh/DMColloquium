# DMColloquium

During first course of my university studies we worked at this project with my stream. This work was made for my colloquium, our task was program creation, which calculate all types of big numbers (natural numbers, rational numbers, etc).

We worked on small pieces of the project in groups of two students. My group realized addition of one digit to natural number and on subtraction of one polynomial from another. See NaturalNumber.cpp and Polynomial.cpp in "QualityCotrol_4308" branch.
